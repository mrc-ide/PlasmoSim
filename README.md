# PlasmoSim

PlasmoSim is an R package for simulating both epidemiological and genetic data from a simple model of *Plasmodium falciparum* transmission. The model itself is fairly lightweight, which speeds up computation times and in turn allows us to model multiple demes (partially isolated sub-populations) connected by migration. This allows us to explore interesting spatial questions relating to patterns of *P. falciparum* genetic structure.

All documentation, including installation instructions and tutorials, are on [the PlasmoSim website](https://mrc-ide.github.io/PlasmoSim).
